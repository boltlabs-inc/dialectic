/// The `Session` extension trait gives methods to create session-typed channels from session types.
/// These are implemented as static methods on the session type itself.
///
/// This trait is already implemented for all valid session types, and cannot be extended by users
/// of this crate.
///
/// # Examples
///
/// ```
/// use dialectic::prelude::*;
/// use dialectic_tokio_mpsc as mpsc;
///
/// let (c1, c2) = <Session! { send String }>::channel(mpsc::unbounded_channel);
/// // do something with these channels...
/// ```
///
/// # Counterexamples
///
/// It is only possible to create a session-typed channel when the session type is valid. The
/// following examples fail, for the reasons described:
///
/// 1. The session type `send &'a str` for a non-static `'a` is not `'static`, but all
///    session types must be `'static`:
///
///    ```compile_fail
///    # use dialectic::prelude::*;
///    # use dialectic_tokio_mpsc as mpsc;
///    fn something<'a>(_: &'a str) {
///        let (c1, c2) = <Session! { send &'a str }>::channel(mpsc::unbounded_channel);
///    }
///    ```
///
/// 2. The session type `Loop<Continue<1>>` is not `Scoped`, because `Continue<1>` must occur
///    within two nested [`Loop`]s to be properly scoped:
///
///    ```compile_fail
///    # use dialectic::prelude::*;
///    # use dialectic_tokio_mpsc as mpsc;
///    use dialectic::types::{Loop, Continue};
///    use dialectic::unary::types::*;
///    let (c1, c2) = <Loop<Continue<1>>>::channel(mpsc::unbounded_channel);
///    ```
///
///    Note that you cannot write out an ill-scoped session type using the
///    [`Session!`](crate::Session@macro) macro, because it will throw an error if you try.
///
/// 3. The session type `loop {}` is not `Actionable` because it is an "unproductive"
///    infinite loop, where no matter how many times you loop, there will never be an available
///    action to perform on the channel:
///
///    ```compile_fail
///    # use dialectic::prelude::*;
///    # use dialectic_tokio_mpsc as mpsc;
///    let (c1, c2) = <Session! { loop {} }>::channel(mpsc::unbounded_channel);
///    ```
