/// A bidirectional communications channel using the session type `P` over the connections `Tx` and

/// not [`CanonicalChan`] directly.** [Read more
/// here.](crate::canonical::CanonicalChan#technical-notes-on-canonicity-tldr-always-write-chan)
///
/// The fourth `E` parameter to a [`CanonicalChan`] is a type-level list describing the *session
/// environment* of the channel: the stack of [`Loop`]s the channel has entered. When a loop
/// repeats, the next session type is retrieved by selecting the `N`th element of this list.
///
/// # Creating new `Chan`s: use [`NewSession`](crate::NewSession)
///
/// To construct a new `Chan`, use one of the static methods of [`NewSession`](crate::NewSession) on
/// the session type for which you want to create a channel. Here, we create two `Chan`s with the
/// session type `Send<String>` and its dual `Recv<String>`, wrapping an underlying bidirectional
/// transport built from a pair of [`tokio::sync::mpsc::channel`]s:
///
/// ```
/// use dialectic::prelude::*;
/// use dialectic::backend::mpsc;
///
/// # #[tokio::main]
/// # async fn main() -> Result<(), Box<dyn std::error::Error>> {
/// // Make a pair of channels:
/// // - `c1` with the session type `Send<String>`, and
/// // - `c2` with the dual session type `Recv<String>`
/// let (c1, c2) = <Send<String>>::channel(|| mpsc::channel(1));
/// # Ok(())
/// # }
/// ```
///
/// If you already have a sender and receiver and want to wrap them in a `Chan`, use the
/// [`wrap`](crate::NewSession::wrap) method for a session type. This is useful, for example, if
/// you're talking to another process over a network connection, where it's not possible to build
/// both halves of the channel on one computer, and instead each computer will wrap one end of the
/// connection:
///
/// ```
/// # use dialectic::prelude::*;
/// # use dialectic::backend::mpsc;
/// #
/// # #[tokio::main]
/// # async fn main() -> Result<(), Box<dyn std::error::Error>> {
/// let (tx, rx) = mpsc::channel(1);
/// let c = <Send<String>>::wrap(tx, rx);
/// # Ok(())
/// # }
/// ```
///
/// # Technical notes on canonicity: TL;DR: always write `Chan`
///
/// In Dialectic, operations are liberally available on [`Chan`](super::Chan)s wherever they make
/// sense. For instance, it's valid to call [`send`](CanonicalChan::send) on a channel which was
/// created using the session type `Loop<Send<String>>`, even though the type does not literally
/// begin with `Send<String>`.
///
/// A `CanonicalChan` always has a session type which is syntactically a real action: it will never
/// be [`Loop`], [`Continue`], or [`Break`] (or, when inside a [`Loop`], it will never be [`Done`]).
/// Every action available on a [`CanonicalChan`] "fast-forwards" through such control operators,
/// yielding a [`CanonicalChan`] that corresponds to the next real action available.
///
/// While this design means greater flexibility and concision in writing session-typed code, it can
/// be confusing in the case where you want to explicitly write out the session type of a channel,
/// because the automatic canonicalization can mean a [`Chan`](super::Chan) does not have the type
/// you might think it does.
///
/// ‚ö†Ô∏è **The problem:** Suppose you wanted to explicitly annotate the type of a new channel:
///
/// ```compile_fail
/// # use dialectic::prelude::*;
/// # use dialectic::backend::mpsc;
/// use dialectic::canonical::CanonicalChan;
///
/// type P = Loop<Send<String>>;
/// let (c1, c2): (CanonicalChan<_, _, P, ()>, _) = P::channel(mpsc::unbounded_channel);
/// ```
///
/// This fails to typecheck, returning several errors (abridged for clarity):
///
/// ```text
/// error[E0271]: type mismatch resolving `<Loop<Send<String>> as Actionable>::Action == Loop<Send<String>>`
///    = note: expected struct `Loop<Send<_>>`
///               found struct `Send<_>`
///
/// error[E0271]: type mismatch resolving `<Loop<Send<String>> as Actionable>::Env == ()`
///    = note: expected unit type `()`
///                    found type `(Send<String>, ())`
/// ```
///
/// These errors indicate that the returned [`CanonicalChan`] from `P::channel` *does not* have the
/// session type `P` and the initial empty environment `E = ()`, as annotated. Instead, it has the
/// session type and environment corresponding to the *inside* of the `Loop`, which are the
/// *canonical* session type and environment for `P`.
///
/// üí° **Do this instead:** When annotating the types of channels, prefer the type synonym
/// [`Chan`](super::Chan), which computes the correct [`CanonicalChan`] type for a given (possibly
/// non-canonical) session type. Using [`Chan`](super::Chan) instead of [`CanonicalChan`], we can
/// correctly annotate a newly created channel of any session type:
///
/// ```
