//! # What is Dialectic?
//!
//! > **dialectic (noun):** The process... of arriving at the truth by stating a thesis, developing
//! a contradictory antithesis, and combining and resolving them into a coherent synthesis.
//! >
//! > **dialectic (crate):** Zero-cost session types for asynchronous Rust.
//!
//! When two concurrent processes communicate, it's good to give their messages *types*, which
//! ensure every message is of an expected form.
//!
//! - **Conventional types** merely describe **what is valid** to communicate.
//! - **Session types** describe **when it is valid** to communicate, and **in what manner**.
//!
//! This crate provides a generic wrapper [`Chan`](crate::Chan) around almost any type of
//! asynchronous channel that adds compile-time guarantees that a specified *session protocol* will
//! not be violated by any code using the channel. Such a wrapped channel:
//!
//! - has **zero runtime cost** in time or memory;
//! - is **built on `async`/`.await`** to allow integration with Rust's powerful `async` ecosystem;
//! - gracefully handles runtime protocol violations, introducing **no panics**; and
//! - allows for **full duplex concurrent communication**, if specified in its type, while
//!   preserving all the same session-type safety guarantees.
//!
//! Together, these make Dialectic ideal for writing networked services that need to ensure high
//! levels of availability and complex protocol correctness properties in the real world -- where
//! protocols might be violated and connections might be dropped.
//!
//! # What now?
//!
//! - If you are **new to the idea of session types** (or haven't seen them presented in Rust
//!   before), you might want to start with the [crate tutorial below](#getting-started).
//! - If you're **familiar with session types**, you might want to check out the
//!   [`types`](crate::types) module to familiarize yourself with the language of types and their
//!   relevant traits, then look at [the reference documentation for `Chan`](crate::Chan).
//! - If you want to **integrate your own channel type** with Dialectic, you need to implement the
//!   [`Transmit`] and [`Receive`] traits from the [`backend`] module.
//!
//! # Getting started
//!
//! The first step to communicating is figuring out what you mean to say.
//!
//! This crate provides a concise [type-level language for expressing session types](crate::types).
//! The session type attached to a wrapped communications channel indicates precisely which actions
//! are available for each end of the channel.
//!
//! Let's write our first session type:
//!
//! ```
//! use dialectic::*;
//!
//! type JustSendOneString = Send<String, End>;
//! ```
//!
//! This type specifies a very simple protocol: "send a string, then finish." The first argument to
//! `Send` is the type sent, and the second is the rest of the protocol, which in this case is the
//! empty protocol [`End`].
//!
//! Every session type has a [`Dual`](crate::Session::Dual), which describes what the other end of
//! the channel must do to follow the channel's protocol; if one end [`Send`]s, the other end must
//! [`Recv`]:
//!
//! ```
//! # use dialectic::*;
//! # use static_assertions::assert_type_eq_all;
//! assert_type_eq_all!(<Send<String, End> as Session>::Dual, Recv<String, End>);
//! ```
//!
//! Because many sessions end with either a `Send` or a `Recv`, their types can be abbreviated when
//! the rest of the session is `End`:
//!
//! ```
//! # use dialectic::*;
//! # use static_assertions::assert_type_eq_all;
//! assert_type_eq_all!(Send<String>, Send<String, End>);
//! assert_type_eq_all!(Recv<String>, Recv<String, End>);
//! ```
//!
//! Given a valid session type, we can wrap an underlying communications channel with it. Here,
//! let's make two ends of a channel for playing out our `JustSendOneString` protocol.
//!
//! In this case, we're using the [`mpsc`](crate::backend::mpsc) backend Dialectic provides, which
//! is built on [`tokio::sync::mpsc`]. However, the mechanism for wrapping underlying channels is
//! extensible, meaning you can choose your own transport if you want.
//!
//! ```
//! # use dialectic::*;
//! use dialectic::backend::mpsc;
//! ```
//!
//! The static method [`channel`](crate::NewSession::channel) is automatically defined for all valid
//! session types (note: its corresponding trait [`NewSession`] needs to be in scope for it to be
//! callable). It takes as input a closure that creates some underlying unidirectional transport
//! channel, and creates a matched pair of bidirectional session-typed channels wrapping the
//! underlying channel type.
//!
//! ```
//! # use dialectic::*;
//! # use dialectic::backend::mpsc;
//! # type JustSendOneString = Send<String, End>;
//! let (c1, c2) = JustSendOneString::channel(|| mpsc::channel(1));
//! ```
//!
//! The types of `c1` and `c2` are inferred from the session type specified: `c1`'s type corresponds
//! to the given session type, and `c2`'s type corresponds to its dual:
//!
//! ```
//! # use dialectic::*;
//! # use dialectic::backend::mpsc;
//! # type JustSendOneString = Send<String, End>;
//! # let (c1, c2) = JustSendOneString::channel(|| mpsc::channel(1));
//! let _: Chan<mpsc::Sender, mpsc::Receiver, Send<String>> = c1;
//! let _: Chan<mpsc::Sender, mpsc::Receiver, Recv<String>> = c2;
//! ```
//!
//! Now that we have the two ends of a bidirectional session-typed channel, we can use them to
//! concurrently enact the protocol specified by their type. In this case, we're going to run them
//! in two parallel [`tokio`] tasks. However, Dialectic is generic over the underlying async
//! runtime, provided the underlying transport channel is of a compatible type.
//!
//! ```
//! # use dialectic::*;
//! # use dialectic::backend::mpsc;
//! # type JustSendOneString = Send<String, End>;
//! # #[tokio::main]
//! # async fn main() -> Result<(), Box<dyn std::error::Error>> {
//! # let (c1, c2) = JustSendOneString::channel(|| mpsc::channel(1));
//! tokio::spawn(async move {
//!     c1.send("Hello, world!".to_string()).await?;
//!     Ok::<_, mpsc::Error>(())
//! });
//!
//! let (greeting, c2) = c2.recv().await?;
//! assert_eq!(greeting, "Hello, world!");
//! # Ok(())
//! # }
//! ```
//!
//! ðŸŽ‰ **Tada!** We've just written an asynchronous session-typed program with Dialectic!
//!
//! # Moving forward
//!
//! Almost every operation on a `Chan`:
//!
//! - is **asynchronous** due to the inherent asynchrony of the protocol,
//! - is **fallible** to account for issues in the underlying transport channel,
//! - and **takes ownership** of the `Chan` upon which it is invoked to enforce type correctness.
//!
//! As a result, each invocation of an operation on a channel is usually followed by an `.await?`,
//! and the result of each operation should usually be rebound via `let` to the same name as the
//! original channel. Like this:
//!
//! ```no_run
//! # use dialectic::*;
//! # use dialectic::backend::mpsc;
//! # type JustSendOneString = Send<String, End>;
//! # #[tokio::main]
//! # async fn main() -> Result<(), Box<dyn std::error::Error>> {
//! type Protocol = Send<String, Recv<u64, Send<bool>>>;
//! let (c1, _) = Protocol::channel(|| mpsc::channel(1));
//!
//! // `send` returns the channel
//! let c1 = c1.send("Hello, world!".to_string()).await?;
//!
//! // `recv` returns a pair of (received value, channel)
//! let (i, c1) = c1.recv().await?;
//!
//! // When we're done with a channel, we close it
//! c1.send(i % 2 == 0).await?.close();
//! # Ok(())
//! # }
//! ```
//!
//! # Getting stopped
//!
//! The most important benefit to session typing is not what it lets you do, but rather, what it
//! *prevents you from doing*. Below are some things we *can't do* with our `JustSendOneString`
//! channel from above:
//!
//! ```
//! # use dialectic::*;
//! type JustSendOneString = Send<String, End>;
//! ```
//!
//! Trying to do any of the below things results in a compile-time type error (edited for brevity).
//!
//! If we try to send on the end of the channel that's meant to receive...
//!
//! ```compile_fail
//! # use dialectic::*;
//! # use dialectic::backend::mpsc;
//! # type JustSendOneString = Send<String, End>;
//! # #[tokio::main]
//! # async fn main() -> Result<(), Box<dyn std::error::Error>> {
//! let (c1, c2) = JustSendOneString::channel(|| mpsc::channel(1));
//! c2.send("Hello, world!".to_string()).await?;
//! # Ok(())
//! # }
//! ```
//!
//! ...we get an error telling us exactly that:with another implementation of session types in Rust
//!
//! ```text
//! error[E0599]: no method named `send` found for struct `Chan<Sender, Receiver, Recv<String>>` in the current scope
//! ```
//!
//! If we try to receive the wrong type of thing...
//!
//! ```compile_fail
//! # use dialectic::*;
//! # use dialectic::backend::mpsc;
//! # type JustSendOneString = Send<String, End>;
//! # #[tokio::main]
//! # async fn main() -> Result<(), Box<dyn std::error::Error>> {
//! let (c1, c2) = JustSendOneString::channel(|| mpsc::channel(1));
//! c1.send("Hello, world!".to_string()).await?;
//! let (n, c2): (i64, _) = c2.recv().await?;
//! # Ok(())
//! # }
//! ```
//!
//! ...we get an error informing us so:
//!
//! ```text
//! error[E0308]: try expression alternatives have incompatible types
//!    |
//!    | let (n, c2): (i64, _) = c2.recv().await?;
//!    |                         ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^ expected `i64`, found struct `String`
//! ```
//!
//! But the unique power session types bring to the table is enforcing the validity of *sequences*
//! of messages. If we try to send twice in a row...
//!
//! ```compile_fail
//! # use dialectic::*;
//! # use dialectic::backend::mpsc;
//! # type JustSendOneString = Send<String, End>;
//! # #[tokio::main]
//! # async fn main() -> Result<(), Box<dyn std::error::Error>> {
//! let (c1, c2) = JustSendOneString::channel(|| mpsc::channel(1));
//! let c1 = c1.send("Hello, world!".to_string()).await?;
//! c1.send("Hello again!".to_string()).await?;
//! # Ok(())
//! # }
//! ```
//!
//! ...we get an error we saying the returned channel is now of type `Chan<_, _, End>`, and we can't
//! send when it's the end:
//!
//! ```text
//! error[E0599]: no method named `send` found for struct `Chan<Sender, Receiver, End>` in the current scope
//! ```
//!
//! # Branching out
//!
//! Most interesting protocols don't just consist of linear sequences of [`Send`]s and [`Recv`]s.
//! Sometimes, one party offers the other a choice of different ways to proceed, and the other
//! chooses which path to take.
//!
//! In Dialectic, this possibility is represented by the [`Offer`] and [`Choose`] types. Each is
//! parameterized by a *tuple* of session types representing, respectively, the choices offered by
//! one end of the channel, or the choices available to choose from.
//!
//! `Offer` is dual to `Choose` if the choices offered are dual to the choices available to choose
//! from:
//!
//! ```
//! # use dialectic::*;
//! # use static_assertions::assert_type_eq_all;
//! assert_type_eq_all!(
//!     <Offer<(Send<String>, Recv<i64>)> as Session>::Dual,
//!     Choose<(Recv<String>, Send<i64>)>,
//! );
//! ```
